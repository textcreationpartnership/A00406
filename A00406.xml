            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is no leſſe triuiall then fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous; and the beſt Apology (in my iudgement) that we can make is, the iniquity of theſe times, wherein the arrogant Athieſt, the looſe Libertine, the ſhallow conceited Schyſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the peſtilent Papiſt, the carnall Profeſſour, &amp;c. ſeeme to breathe forth their infectious blaſts, and proclaime defiance to Gods glory, and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian piety: This indeed ſhould rouſe vp, and awake, the Tribe of <hi>Leuy,</hi> to gird their ſpirituall ſword vpon their thigh, to <hi>fight, the good fight of the Lord,</hi>

            <p>For the firſt, there are two things to be conſidered; his name who he was, and his office. His name he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth that it was <hi>Iames.</hi> I find that among ſome ancient Writers, there hath beene ſome controuerſie heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about; ſome affirming, that there were three of his name, and all <hi>viri Apoſtolici,</hi> Apoſtolicall men, and that it is vncertaine to which this Epiſtle is to bee aſcribed: the firſt they ſay was <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſonne of <hi>Zebedee, whom Herod killed with the Sword.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> The other they would haue to be the ſonne of <hi>Alphaeus,</hi> who had to his brethren the Apoſtles, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Iude.</hi> The third they thinke was one of the 72.

He was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iames</hi> the Leſſe, as the Greekes vſe the word in the Poſitiue degree, not that he was inferiour in zeale or authoritie vnto the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but becauſe he was leſſe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſhorter of ſtature then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Hee was alſo called <hi>Iames</hi> the Iuſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the moſt excellent gifts of the Holy-ghoſt, and moſt ſingular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that ſhined forth in him. <note place="margin">Hegiſippus</note> For as <hi>Hegiſippus</hi> witneſſeth, who ſucceeded the Apoſtles, that he was holy from his Mothers wombe, after the maner of the Nazarites, hee neuer dranke
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18915:11"/>wine nor ſtrong drinke, the Raſor neuer came vpon his head, he abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Oile and Baths, hee neuer wore a Wollen, but a Linnen veſture called a <hi>Syndon,</hi> with continuall prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his knees were growne ſo hard as a Camels skinne: he was had in ſuch holy reputation among the people, that they preſſed to touch the hem of his veſture. He was called alſo the Brother of the Lord, <note place="margin">Galat. 1.</note> not as ſome Greeke Writers vntruely ſuppoſe that hee was the ſonne of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> by his firſt wife, before hee tooke the bleſſed Virgine, but becauſe he was the ſonne of <hi>Mary Cleopha</hi> coſin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſo CHRISTS kinſman, and therfore his Brother after the manner of the Hebrews, which call them that are of their next bloud, Brethren, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham calleth his nephew Lot,</hi>

               <hi>Brother.</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> calleth <hi>Iacob,</hi> his Coſin, <hi>Brother.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Geneſ. 29</note> Thus the Hebrewes called them Brethren, that were of affinitie and kindred, in which reſpect <hi>Iames</hi> is called the Lords Brother, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18915:11"/>hee was his kinſeman after the fleſh. He was the firſt Biſhoppe of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> appointed by the Lord himſelfe, as <hi>Clemens</hi> writeth, and conſtituted by the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. The Iewes, <note place="margin">Clemens.</note> for his admirable holineſſe of life, permitted him to come into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum:</hi> he wore on his head, the <hi>Petalon,</hi> that is, <hi>Epiſcopi inſigne,</hi> the Biſhops marke or attire, as <hi>Hegiſippus</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> write; he gouerned the Church with great praiſe for the ſpace of thirtie yeares, and was at laſt martyred, being caſt from a Pinnacle of the Temple, and afterward his braines daſhed out with a clubbe. This te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie (Brethren) ſhould procure no little authoritie with the hearers of this Epiſtle; &amp; attention: for who is ſo blockiſh and fooliſh which will not reuerence ſo great an Apoſtle, an Ambaſſadour of the eternall Sonne of GOD, by the teſtimony of the Iewes themſelues a moſt holie man, the firſt Paſtor of the firſt Church, ordained by Chriſt himſelf to preach
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18915:12"/>his Goſpel? Notwithſtanding there haue not wanted ſome (ſuch is the policie of Sathan) which haue gone about to diſcredite the authoritie of this Epiſtle, as if it ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Tertul. libr.

            <p>Firſt (ſay they) he calleth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Their firſt reaſon.</note> but a Seruant of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. This reaſon is very friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth himſelfe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Seruant nor Apoſtle of Chriſt, ſhould wee therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1.</note> that <hi>Iohn</hi> was neither the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle nor the Seruant of Chriſt? Were not this abſurd? By the like reaſon we might inferre, that Saint <hi>Iude</hi> was no Apoſtle, becauſe hee termeth himſelfe the Seruant of Chriſt, and brother to this <hi>Iames.</hi> If a King in his Title ſhould call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Seruant of God, and omit the name of his Kingdome, were he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18915:12"/>not therefore a King? Away with ſuch friuolous reaſons.</p>
            <p>Another as fooliſh a reaſon they haue, <note place="margin">Their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> that this Stile ſauoureth not of the <hi>Haebraiſmus,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe, as is expected of ſo great an Apoſtle, and firſt Biſhop of Hieruſalem. To this I anſwer, as <hi>Cicero</hi> did once; <hi>vappis, ac lippis &amp; in tenui farragine mendacibus:</hi> To the rabble of liars, dizzards, and pur-blinde perſons it ſeemeth ſo, but to ſuch as are well acquainted with the <hi>Hebrew Idiome,</hi> it ſeemeth farre otherwiſe. Indeede, it was not expedient, that hee being by Nation and Tongue an Hebrew, and yet writing in Greeke, ſhould be tyed to the tropes of the Hebrew tongue: Againe, <note place="margin">Actes 2.</note> ſeeing hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the Holie-ghoſt, the gift of all Tongues, it was no hard thing for him to abſtaine from the obſcure <hi>Hebraiſmus,</hi> and to vſe the more plaine Greeke phraſe; and laſtly, it is falſe, that hee vſeth no Hebrew phraſe: for <hi>gignere verbo veritatis,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſe 18.</note> To beget with the word of Trueth, is a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18915:13"/>plaine <hi>Hebraiſmus,</hi> vſed for the true doctrine, as <hi>filius perditionis,</hi> the ſon of perdition, for <hi>filio perdito.</hi> Againe, hee calleth the Goſpel the Law of Libertie, <note place="margin">Verſe 25.</note> after the Hebrew phraſe, for a perfect Law which bringeth true liberty to the beleeuers and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers thereof. Againe, <hi>generare mortem,</hi> after the manner of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew phraſe, to bring certaine and preſent deſtruction, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next, he expreſſeth his office and profeſsion, which is the ſecond part of this <hi>Epigrapha, The Seruant of God.</hi> But why; omitting the name of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle or Diſciple, calleth he himſelf <hi>The Seruant of God?</hi> Surely (as the Learned do anſwer to this queſtion) when he might haue termed himſelfe an Apoſtle, an Ambaſſadour of the high God, the brother of our Lord, or any more lofty Title; he chooſeth rather the title of a Seruant, aſwell for that he is delighted with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, after the example of Chriſt, who <hi>made himſelfe of no reputation,</hi>

So the patient man hath ſuch ſoliditie of minde, that being put into the fire of tribulation, doth neither euaporate through anger and impatiency, neither is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the weight of vertue, through diffidence and diſtruſt, or conſumed through puſillanimity, or faint-heartedneſſe, but is made the more pure, and ſhineth the more bright in vertue, <note place="margin">1.

            <p>Contrariwiſe the deuill himſelfe is the perſwader and authour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; for, not able to ſuffer that God had made all things ſubiect vnto man, through enuy deceiued he our firſt parents, diſcontented with their eſtate, which brought all miſery to them and their poſterity. <hi>Cain,</hi>

            <p>Here (brethren) wee ſee that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and ſuffering of aduerſity, <note place="margin">None a perfect Chriſtian without patience.</note> is ſo neceſſary vnto a Chriſtian man, that without it hee can indeed bee no perfect Chriſtian: For againſt the fiery darts of the deuill, through innumerable ſnares, through infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite aſſaults, wee muſt paſſe through and <hi>endure to the end,</hi> before wee come to our heauenly Country: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe therefore wee bee armed with a ſtrong and conſtant patience wee ſhall often faint before wee come to the midſt of our courſe; <note place="margin">Heb. 10.36 <hi>Nulla an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps lucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men init virtute ſine iſta.

            <p>This is the true patience, which is not ouercome with any aduerſity, and is exerciſed chiefly in ſuffering three things, which are: <hi>Oris oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, corporis flagella, damna temporalia,</hi> the reproches of mens mouthes, <note place="margin">Patience exerciſed chiefly in three things.</note> the ſtripes of body, temporall loſſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which a certaine Schoole-man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth all aduerſity, which the true patience muſt vanquiſh.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is not ouercome with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious ſpeeches, for commonly the wicked are wont to load the godly with contumelies, iniuries, reproches, and tauntings, ſcoffings, and raylings, and ſuch like.

Let not a man ſay he is tempted of God, when pleaſure pricketh him, when enuy renteth him, when pride prouoketh him, when couetouſneſſe catcheth him, when the world enticeth him, or any other temptation aſſaileth him, let him not, I ſay, impute this vnto God: For it is an horrible

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The naturall hardneſſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto all men, for all men are borne with a hard heart, and a minde darkened: and therefore GOD, in the holy Scripture, by his Prophet ſaith, that in regeneration, or new birth, he will take away their ſtony, and flinty heart, that is, their hard heart, and giue them a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18915:80"/>fleſhy heart, that is a ſoft and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied heart, flexible vnto good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <note place="margin">Ezoch 36.</note> Whereby it is manifeſt that when God is ſaid to harden, it is not ſo to bee vnderſtood as if hee did harden them which before were ſoft and flexible: but thus; that it, which by his owne nature is hard, he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſtill to bee hard, and through his iuſt iudgements (but <hi>per accidens</hi>) more and more, by the meanes of Sathan, to bee hardened. And how? <hi>Per accidens:</hi> Surely becauſe God heerein worketh no euill, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill abuſeth Gods benefites beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon a man to his obduration and hardening of his heart, and cauſeth a wicked man, of his owne accord, to abuſe the ſame to his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it is to be ſeen in <hi>Pharas,</hi> and therefore in this kind of harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there is no compulſion, but a man is voluntarily hardned: and in this reſpect Sathan hardneth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond kind, is called a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary obduration, or hardening, when man hardeneth his owne
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18915:80"/>heart: which is, when a man confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and hardeneth himſelfe in euill purpoſe; neither will hee heare nor bee obedient to the voyce of the Lord, or to any admonitions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee is called to repentance, but abuſeth Gods ſuffering to his owne damnation, which not onely <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> did, but alſo <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and many other, though wee doe not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly reade of them, as wee do of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that God hardened their hearts, but onely becauſe they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſtood obſtinate in their owne conceiued wickednes, againſt all admonitions: And thus not God, but man hardeneth himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is called the Diuine or Iudiciall hardening; that is, when God as an vpright Iudge puniſheth their former ſinnes, and the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtubbornneſſe of the wicked, by more and more hardening their heart by the miniſtery of Sathan, being partly already of their owne nature obdurate, and partly alſo by the ſinnes of the wicked hardened:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18915:81"/>ſuch properly was the hardening of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo often mentioned in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,</hi> and in the ninth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> and beſides other places, in the ninth of <hi>Exodus</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>Pharaoh ſinned, and hardened his heart.</hi> Firſt, it is ſaid hee ſinned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing plainly the cauſe of obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is his ſinne: next, <hi>his heart was hardened,</hi> ſhewing the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne, which is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart; <note place="margin">Hardneſſe of heart is ſinne, the cauſe of ſinne, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne.</note> For <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe firſt ſinned: then God, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſinne, hardned more and more his heart; ſo that hardneſſe of heart is ſinne, the puniſhment of ſinne, and the cauſe of ſinne. Heere now it is manifeſt that ſinne, and the cuſtome of ſinning, is that which hardneth the heart of the wicked, and therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that hee ſinned, and <hi>his heart was hardned;</hi> and the Scripture plainely teacheth, that GOD hardneth, Sathan hardneth, and Man himſelfe hardeneth his owne heart, but in a diuerſe ſence, &amp; after a diuerſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18915:81"/>It is ſpoken of God, not as the authour of euill, but <hi>per accidens,</hi> by doing good, by beſtowing his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, by vſing well the wicked putpoſes of the vngodly, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them, as a ſoueraigne agent, vnto a good end. Sathan hardneth as the authour of ſinne, blindneſſe, and prince of darkeneſſe, he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the wicked, peruerteth the good motions which God inſtilleth into their minds, and vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of good abuſeth them to euill, vnto their owne deſtruction, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſophiſtically concludeth, and ſheweth reaſons to effect it, and therefore hee is called <hi>Princeps tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarum,</hi> Prince of darkeneſſe: <hi>Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkeneſſe,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Colloſ. 1.</note> from the power of Sathan: <note place="margin">Iohn 13.</note> the example of <hi>Iudas</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth manifeſt this, who did not ſo obſtinately proceed, before the diuel entred into him, and began wholy to carry him after his will: Firſt he conſented to the counſell of Sathan, but after the taking of the ſop; he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18915:82"/>fully poſſeſſed him, and this is called of the Diuines; <hi>proxima cauſa indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationis, quae extra hominem conſiderari poteſt:</hi> The next cauſe of obduration which may bee conſidered without man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, man himſelfe hardneth his owne heart, who of his owne will turneth his heart from God, and aſſenteth to the counſell of Sathan: <hi>Ad actiones ſimpliciter à Deo motus, &amp; ad peccandum alectus à diabiolo</hi> (ſaith a Father) being of God ſimply mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to actions, but of the deuill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to ſinne. By ſinning willingly and perſeuering in ſinne, he obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately hardeneth his heart to reſiſt God, abuſing all Gods benefites to his owne deſtruction; for except the will of man conſented there could bee no hardening, for to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the heart, is nothing elſe but the will to be more and more obſtinate in an vngodly purpoſe. So that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hardeneth by ſuggeſting, Man by conſenting,
<note place="margin">Aug. con. Fauſlum</note> God by forſaking, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> pitihily ſaith: <hi>Diabolus

               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe, but thy helpe commeth onely of mee.</hi> This being ſo, I conclude with the Apoſtle: <hi>Let no man ſay when hee is tempted, I am tempted of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond thing I mentioned is the temptation, to ſeduce &amp; deceiue, drawing, mouing, and ſtirring vs forward to all wickedneſſe. And of this temptation there are two kinds: externall and internall; externall is that whoſe cauſe is outward, and beginning thereof, as when ſathan vſeth the world, riches, glory, euill examples, as meanes to allure vs: Of his ſnares it is ſaid: <note place="margin">Iob. 18.</note> 
               <hi>A ſnare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</hi> The ſnare and the trap are the deuils inſtruments to catch ſoules. The deuill is like a Fowler or a Hunter, <note place="margin">A Simile.</note> who that hee may take birds or wilde beaſts, ſheweth forth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18915:83"/>a pleaſant bait, but hideth the ſnare, that being allured with the baite, they may bee caught with the ſnare: For when he promiſeth to the proud man honours, to the couetous man mony, to the looſe man pleaſures, &amp;c. what doth he elſe, but vnder the baite, hide the net and the ſnare, that he may catch vnwary ſoules? The Latine more plainly expreſſeth it: <hi>Abſcondita eſt in terra pedica eius, &amp; decipula ſuper ſemitas:</hi> His ſnare is hidden in the ground, and his trap vpon his pathes. In which words (as a father noteth) are ſignified two kinds of temptations. <note place="margin">Hugo Card.</note> The one open, which, except it be hidden vnder the colour of ſome good, it is perceiued of all men, and this is ſignified <hi>per pedicam,</hi> by the ginne which is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ground, as is fornication, and other carnall ſinnes. The other more ſecret, ſubtile, and hidden, which ſcarce of the wiſe is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which is ſignified <hi>per decipulam,</hi> by a deceitfull trap. The deuill then hath his ginne and his trappe, for all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18915:83"/>kinds of men, for he knoweth the manners of men, and to what vice they are moſt prone, and layeth that baite before their eyes to which hee knoweth their minde will bee moſt eaſily inclined: as to effeminate, ioyfull, and delicate men, the bait of lechery, and vaine-glory; to <hi>Stoicall,</hi> ſterne, and angry men, the baite of wrath and pride, &amp;c. And which is moſt to bee feared, he worketh not this by himſelfe onely, but alſo by his ſeruants and inſtruments. And euen as a Prince, or noble-man, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Hunting or Hauking, hath many hunters and ſeruants that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and whatſoeuer is taken in hunting is aſcribed all vnto the Prince: <note place="margin">The deuill hath his agents.</note> So the deuill hath his gard, hath his hunters to take ſoules. For what elſe ſhall wee call the whooriſh woman, <note place="margin">Note this.</note> the fraudulent friend, the alluring companion, him that keepeth a houſe of play and baudry, but the diuels Huntſmen? for ſo the Lord himſelfe calleth them; <note place="margin">Ier. 5.</note> 
               <hi>There are found among my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18915:84"/>wicked perſons, that lay waite, as hee that ſetteth ſnares, they haue made a pit to catch men.</hi> What remaineth then (brethren) but that we hearken to the counſell of the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>Bee ſober and watch, for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary the denill as a roaring Lyon wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth about, ſeeking whom hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure.</hi> Yee had need to bee very carefull and vigilant, for yee haue to do with a moſt vigilant enemy, which compaſſeth you with a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſire to hurt you, ſeeking not onely whom hee may wound, but alſo kill and deuoure. <note place="margin">Simile.</note> If any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier or Marriner ſhould fall into the hand of the Turke, and bee carried vnto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though he would greatly feare to fall into the hands of ſo cruell an enemy, of the name of Chriſt, yet hee hath ſome hope of redemption, for ſiluer and gold may redeeme him: but if hee fall into the hands of the <hi>Lyſtrigons,</hi> or <hi>Canibals,</hi> which as ſoone as they haue taken men, preſently deuoure them aliue: What hope then remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18915:84"/>O man, created after the image of God, that thou mighteſt enioy eternall bleſſedneſſe, take heed of this cruell enemy, which, as a bloudy beaſt, deſtroyeth and deuoureth men, truſt him not, enter into no friendſhip with him, there is no hope of fauour to be expected at his hands.</p>
            <p>The third kind of temptation is, <hi>preſumptionis,</hi> of preſumption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man tempteth God; as when men abuſe Gods patience, and ſuffering, to a ſecurity of ſinning, flattering and deceiuing themſelues in the mercy of God, and finall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> and in the meane time wallow in their wickedneſſe, ſin with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, ſaying; I haue ſinned, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.</note> and what euill hath happened vnto me? The Lord hath mercy in ſtore for vs all, hee will receiue me whenſoeuer I come, I will repent at the houre of death, and I ſhall doe well enough, &amp;c. This is a preſumptuous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God, an abuſing (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) of the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18915:85"/>patience, and long-ſuffering: and thoſe doe, <hi>Theſaurizare ſibi iram in diem irae:</hi>

               <hi>Heape vp vnto themſelues wrath vnto the day of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here let vs learne (brethren) how dangerous a thing it is to deferre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and, while wee haue time, not to turne vnto the Lord: Surely it is a fearefull thing for a ſinner to paſſe the whole race of his life in pleaſure, and to protract repentance to the laſt minute of our life. A wiſe man repaireth and couereth his houſe in Summer, leaſt he be anoyed with the ſtormes of Winter. The prouident Saylor, when the ſea is calme, and the weather faire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things neceſſary againſt a tempeſt, leaſt being preuented with a ſtorme he laboureth in vaine. The breach in a Citty-wall in time of peace, and not in the brunts of battell, is to be repaired. And <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> is reported to haue diſgraded a Knight, becauſe he was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring his armour when hee ſhould encounter with his enemies: So

O vaine man, thou truſteſt then to a broken reede, which by the ſinne of thy firſt parents is bruſed and craſed with a thouſand chinckes of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and laid open vnto death; why doſt thou not then craue of him the conditions of peace, why takeſt thou not truce with him? why with all humility, doſt thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert vnto him with true repentance, craue pardon for thy ſinnes while hee is yet farre off?

            <p>For the firſt, it is manifeſt that this noble ſenſe of hearing was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs of God; that is, the power of diſcerning voices and ſounds: For hee that created the whole body of man, and powred into it a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule, created alſo this ſenſe ſo profitable to his glory, and neceſſary to the attaining of eternall life, and this is it he ſaith:

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18915:89"/>the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">Rom. 10. Luke 11. Iohn 8.</note> 
               <hi>Faith commeth by hearing,</hi> And <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it: Hee that is of God heareth Gods word.</hi> And how ſhould wee vſe this excellent ſenſe to the glory of God, wee are inſtructed in the fabrication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which expreſſeth the wonderfull skill of the Creator.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, the ſound is brought thus into the eares: <note place="margin">How the ſound is brought into the eares.</note> Betweene the bones of the Temples, there is a way <hi>ad baſim cerebri,</hi> to the ground or foundation of the braine, hauing within a certaine concauity after the manner of a labyrinth, in the middle whereof are two little bones an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their membranes, the one called <hi>malleus,</hi> the other <hi>Incus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Malleus Incus.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the vſe thereof, which the

Heere wee are taught, that euen as the ſound is brought into the eare through the agitation of the externall aire: ſo the ſound of the heauenly Doctrine is brought by the Preacher into the minde of the hearer:

More heereof might bee ſpoken, but I am heere to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of a Diuine, and not to play the Anatomiſt in the Phyſitians Art.</p>
            <p>Againe, when the Apoſtle wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to bee ſwift to heare, hee meaneth not an vnfruitfull hearing, that wee may carpe, taunt, or ſcoffe, or giue eare to ſcurrile, filthy, and leud ſpeeches, &amp;c. but as if hee had ſaid: Seeing that God offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto you ſo louingly, ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his holy word, the meane of our regeneration, it behoueth you to ſhew your ſelues attentiue, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, and obedient hearers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dilligence of the people is commended, <note place="margin">Iohn. 6. Math. 14.</note> which forſaking all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18915:92"/>things, yea the care of meate and drinke, came from all parts vnto Chriſt, to heare the word out of his mouth. But now how few be there found, in this declining age, that haue that zeale and loue to the word of God, as to preferre the hearing thereof before their earthly commodities?</p>
            <p>The ſecond precept is of bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the tongue, <note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d precept of bridling the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue.</note> that is, the petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie and loquacitie thereof.

Now euery Artificer, Boy, &amp;c. are giuen not onely quick to ſpeake, but alſo to teach, yea their owne Paſtors, of whom they ſhould learne with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, heare with ſilence, and aske counſell with humbleneſſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> once gaue thankes vnto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had made him <hi>wiſer then his teachers:</hi>

               <hi>Gregory</hi> maketh three <hi>ſpecies</hi> of anger: The firſt is a kind of <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious</hi> paſſion, which is quickly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp; as ſoone calmed, and this hath leſſe danger, and malice: It is like ſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which quickly taketh fire, and quickly goeth out; This the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Cicero excandeſcentia,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ira furor breuis.</note> 
               <hi>An anger ſoone come and ſoone gone:</hi> The Logicians, a Paſſion. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is called of the Latines <hi>Iracun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> which carrieth in minde a longer remembrance of an iniury recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and is of more continuance: This <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though this doth not alwaies proceed to reuenge, either becauſe men cannot, or for certaine reaſons will not: and this is worſe then the firſt, becauſe it is fixed more faſt, and taketh dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per roote in the mind. The third kind is of ſuch which are ſoon kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the flames of anger, &amp; ſlow to repreſſe it: And this is a great ſin ſo long to foſter wrath in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18915:98"/>vntill it turne into hatred: for what is hatred but inueterat wrath? and this ſeeketh all occaſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, which is truely diabolicall. To theſe may bee added a fourth, which is of ſuch as are ſlow to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue wrath, and quick to remit and caſt it off, which is the beſt of all. All theſe are ſinnes, though not in degree equall.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, <note place="margin">Math. 5.22</note> if hee maketh not three kinds, yet three degrees of wrath, when hee ſaith, <hi>Whoſoeuer is angry with his brother vnaduiſedly, ſhall bee culpable of iudgement,</hi> which is meant of that which is hidden, and inward in the heart: The ſecond <hi>Racha,</hi> is that which is expreſſed and manifeſt, yet without any open reproach. The third, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall ſay thou foole, ſhall bee worthy to bee puniſhed with hell fire,</hi> is when it is conuerted into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and manifeſted in tauntes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, and proceedeth to reuenge.</p>
            <p>Anger in generall, being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelfe, is a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to vice or vertue: And therefore
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18915:98"/>the Apoſtle heere doth not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely condemne all anger, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith that a man ſhould be <hi>ſlow to wrath,</hi> that is, wiſe in moderating the ſame: For it is a vertue when it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth reaſon as his guide, that the action of iuſtice might with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage be executed, &amp; puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon malefactours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the iudgement of reaſon, and order of Iuſtice. And the end of this holy anger is manifold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the perſon may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; to which pertaineth this of the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> that <hi>ſuch a one</hi> (he meaneth the inceſtuous perſon) <hi>bee deliuered vnto Sathan for the deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.20</note> 
               <hi>that his Spirit may bee ſaued in the day of the Lord Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that the wrath of God may be pacified: for <hi>if wee iudge our ſelues we ſhall not bee iudged of the Lord.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> Example hereof we haue, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 7. after the puniſhment of <hi>Achan,</hi> the wrath of the Lord was appeaſed: the like wee reade of the zeale of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:18915:99"/>
            <p>Thirdly, the aduancement of Gods glory, and his Kingdome: This is confirmed by the example of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua,</hi> on <hi>Achan; Phinees,</hi> on the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; of <hi>Moſes,</hi> on the Seditious; and of others, of whom wee reade, that, the due puniſhments inflicted vpon wicked men, the wrath of God was pacified.</p>
            <p>And this reaſonable anger is two-fold; <note place="margin">1. In the will.</note> the one in the will, the other in the ſenſitiue Appetite. The firſt is nothing elſe but a voluntary motion, whereby, not by any paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by the iudgement of reaſon, a man hath a deſire to puniſh ſinne. And this may bee in the mildeſt man, as was <hi>Moſes;</hi> yea, it is moſt neceſſary for thoſe that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to puniſh vice; and ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that if it be wanting in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, he doth moſt hainouſly and grieuouſly ſinne, as we may reade of <hi>Helie</hi> the Prieſt, in the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the ſecond and third chapters.</p>
            <p>The other is in the ſenſitiue Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18915:99"/>and is nothing elſe then the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſenſitiue Appetite,
<note place="margin">2. In the ſenſitiue appetite.</note> to be obedient to reaſon for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vice. And this neceſſarily followeth the iudgement of reaſon, and the rule of a iuſt and vpright will. This zealous and holy anger was in Chriſt, when <hi>hee whipped the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple:</hi> And when <hi>Hee looked round about on the Phariſees angerly,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>mourning for the hardneſſe of their heart:</hi> And in <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> when hee brake the Tables, ſeeing the Iſraelites worſhip the Calfe.</p>
            <p>Contrarywiſe, anger is a great ſin againſt God, when it tranſgreſſeth theſe bounds and limits, when it followeth not the right rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but preuenteth, blindeth,
<note place="margin">Homo ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus non eſt home.</note> and peruerteth the ſame, being carried headlong with fury, rage, and a bloudy deſire of reuenge, and this may be termed a mad fury, <hi>Ira furor breuis:</hi> Such was the rage of <hi>Saul,</hi> who for hatred he bare to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 21.</note> moſt cruelly murdered the Prieſts of <hi>Nob.</hi> Of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18915:100"/>hee commanded the male children of the Hebrewes to bee caſt into the riuer.
<note place="margin">Exod. 1.22</note> Of <hi>Herod,</hi> who in hatred of our Sauiour cauſed the <hi>children of Bethlem to be ſlaine.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle heere reproueth this anger, as alſo that which ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth from a deſire of contending, which hindreth the fruitfull hearing of the word of God, whereby men cannot endure to bee reproued of their faults; and being kindled with wrath, raile, taunt and ſcoffe at the Preacher, whereby the word of God is made fruſtrate, and fruitleſſe in them, when through ſelfe-loue, a preiudicate opinion of themſelues, a conceit of their owne wiſedome, they diſdaine to bee reproued, and controuled, in their wicked courſes, and bend all their malice againſt their Paſtors, from whence ſpring perſecutions, impriſonments, &amp;c. This was the cauſe that King <hi>Aſa</hi> put <hi>Hanam</hi> into priſon; and of the fury of the Princes againſt <hi>Iſay,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Ch. 10.16</note> 
               <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, Micha, Amos,</hi> and the reſt. This
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18915:100"/>cauſed <hi>Stephen</hi> to be ſtoned, <note place="margin">Act. 7.54.</note> and all the Apoſtles to bee perſecuted; but Gods vengeance euer purſued the contempt of his Word and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as the booke of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth: <note place="margin">2. Chro. 36 16.</note> 
               <hi>But they mocked the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, vntill the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, and till there was no remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This anger is a moſt grieuous ſin, the reaſon is heere rendred by the Apoſtle: <hi>Becauſe it worketh not the righteouſneſſe of God:</hi> that is, a man poſſeſſed with this Paſſion, leaueth in his heart no place for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God: For in ſuch a one is left no humanity, no commiſeration, no religion, no equity, no iuſtice, no charity at all. <hi>It worketh not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God,</hi> becauſe it baniſheth the feare of God out of our mindes, taketh away loue, and obedience, quencheth brotherly kindneſſe, and vtterly ſpoileth vs of all Chriſtian vertues which are acceptable vnto God. <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay: <note place="margin">

The remedies then are twofold: Some for repreſſing of anger in others, and ſome for brideling the ſame in our ſelues.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſuppreſſing theſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in others, theſe remedies do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <note place="margin">The firſt remedy.</note> 
               <hi>Silence,</hi> that thou anſwere not againe, nor returne to the angry man taunt for taunt, reproach for reproach. This is the counſell of the Wiſeman, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.16, <hi>Striue not with him that is angry, put not ſtickes vnto his fire.</hi> And <hi>Salomon:</hi> For wrath is a fire, and anſwering againe is, as it were, the fuell: <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18915:101"/>wood the fire is quenched:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pro. 22.24. Prouer. 26.</note> And the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Romanes</hi> 12.19. <hi>Auenge not your ſelues but giue place vnto wrath, for vengeance is mine, and I will reuenge ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe it chanceth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that wee are compelled to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere againe,
<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d remedy.</note> as when by our ſilence the angry man is prouoked the more, thinking thereby that he is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Iohn 19.</note> as was the anger of <hi>Pilat</hi> againſt Chriſt; in this caſe another remedy is to be ſought:
<note place="margin">Pro. 25.15.</note> and this is <hi>lingua mollis,</hi> a modeſt and gentle anſwere: Such was the wiſedome of <hi>Abigal</hi> towards <hi>Dauid,</hi> being angry.

            <p>Thirdly, <note place="margin">The third remedy.</note> to winne an enemy by benefites is a ſingular kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, preſcribed both by wiſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and by the bleſſed Apoſtle: <hi>If hee that hateth thee bee hungry giue him bread,</hi>

            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:18915:104"/>
            <p>Firſt, by an elegant metaphor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from husbandry, the Apoſtle teacheth that the noyſome weeds of vices both of body and ſoule, muſt bee firſt rooted vp and extirpated, before the heauenly doctrine, the word of truth, can be receiued, and bee graffed in the field of our hearts: euen as the huſbandmen before they caſt the corne into the ground, do firſt purge their ground of Thornes, Brambles, Stones, and ſuch like, that it may yeeld the more increaſe. For in euery action, either naturall or ſpirituall, two things are neceſſary: <hi>Alterum quod agat, alterum quod patiatur:</hi> The Agent which worketh, and the Patient vpon which it muſt worke. And in the Agent there muſt bee power to worke, and in the Patient or Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a diſpoſition to receiue. For that the earth may bring forth fruite, it is needfull that the Seed bee caſt into it, and that it bee firſt prepared as I ſaid, &amp;c. and if either of theſe bee wanting, in vaine is the hope of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18915:104"/>fruit. The Smith that hee may finiſh his worke, firſt ſoftneth it in the fire, and maketh it tractable; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be molified, in vaine he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to beat the cold Iron. And it is a Maxime in Philoſophie, <hi>Actus actiuorum eſſe in patiente diſpoſiti:</hi> The greater in any thing the diſpoſition is to receiue, the ſooner and more perfect followeth the action. Wee ſee dry wood put into the fire quickly to be kindled, and a candle lately put out, and yet ſmoaking, with the leaſt touch of fire to receiue the flame, and ſometimes without fire, with the breath onely, to bee kindled. So much auaileth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and apt preparation in the thing that receiueth any action. So though I confeſſe the grace of God to bee free, <hi>&amp; nullis aſtrictam legibus,</hi> &amp; bound by no lawes (as <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith) yet this grace commonly imitateth the reaſon and order of naturall things. Hence it followeth, <note place="margin">How wee may profit by hearing the Word.</note> that a man may profite by hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; It is not alwaies enough that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18915:105"/>there be a learned and apt Teacher, vnleſſe the Hearer alſo bee apt and wel diſpoſed, that is, that the ground of his mind be firſt prepared, that he heare not the ſame negligently, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for cuſtome, or in an affection of curioſity, but that hee heare with zeale and deuotion; for there are many that come to Sermons onely to carpe, or to note if the Preacher vtter any ſentence acutely, or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whereby they may feed their curioſity,
<note place="margin">Curious hearers.</note> and not ſatisfie the hunger of their ſoule. And euen as (they ſay) there is ſome ground ſo barren, that, if they ſow the fineſt wheate in it, bringeth not forth wheate againe, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Typha,</hi> a kinde of wilde corne.</note> but <hi>typham,</hi> or chaffe, onely (which in the nature of things is very admirable, ſeeing it is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime in Philoſophy, <hi>Omne agens ſibi ſimile generare,</hi> euery agent ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth his like) So it chanceth vnto them, in whoſe hearts if the word of God be ſowne, it bringeth not forth the frnite of this ſeed, but chaffe, or <hi>Typham,</hi> that is, not the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18915:105"/>fruit of godlineſſe, but the chaffe of vanity.</p>
            <p>Now that this word of God may be vnto vs the ſweete <hi>ſauour of life vnto life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.

            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle alludeth here to the parable of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: <hi>The ſeed is the word of God, whereof ſome fell by the way ſide, ſome among thornes, ſome on ſtony ground, and ſome on good ground.</hi> This ſeed, of it ſelfe, is very fruitfull, but according to the diuerſe conditions of the ground, that is, of the hearers, it yeeldeth none at all, or diuerſe fruit: For the heart of ſome is like an high way which is worne and trodden on of all; that is, which without any choice is laid open to all vncleane thoughts, and deſires. Their heart is like a common Inne which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18915:109"/>and receiueth all kinde of men, good and bad, knowne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, for it maketh no difference of good or euill thoughts. It is like vnto a crazed boate, which leaketh water at euery chinke. It is like a Citie without walles, or gates, which is eaſily inuaded of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Like a vineyard without a hedge, whoſe fruit is ſpoiled of euery one that paſſeth by. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ſuch a ſoule is like vnto a houſe without a dore, or locke, which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one vſeth as a filthy ſtable. And how ſhamefull a thing is it to ſuffer the ſoule to bee thus polluted with all vncleane thoughts, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by this one example: Were it not an indelible ſhame for a woman to fall into the degree of impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to proſtitute her ſelfe in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtewes, <hi>Et omnibus ſui copiam facere?</hi> And what an ignominy then is it vnto the ſoule to receiue within it all vncleane thoughts and deſires, which the deuill offereth, without any difference?

               <p>The firſt of theſe is the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting tongue which is in enuious wretches; heereof the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: <hi>They haue ſharpened their tongues like a Serpent, Adders poyſon is vnder their lips:</hi> And of this hateſome vice of detraction, or back-biting, I will ſay three things.</p>

               <p>The firſt is called <hi>Iniquus,</hi> vniuſt, not that this ſo peſtilent a vice may bee in any ſort iuſtly done, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>Summa iniquitate committitur</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) it is committed with great iniquity, <note place="margin">Aquin.</note> and is moſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the rule of equity, vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and iuſtice, that ſhould bee amongſt men.</p>
               <p>This backbiting for memory ſake I will reduce to three heads, it is three manner of waies committed: <hi>Ruelando, fingendo, ſcribendo;</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing the ſecret infirmities of our neighbour, by forging againſt him, and by writing infamous Libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is in a malicious reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſecret infirmities of our neighbour, of purpoſe to defame him, and impaire his honeſt reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world; contrary to the precept of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Mat. 18.15</note> 
                  <hi>If thy brother ſinne go tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone.</hi> This euill how great it is, and how largely it hath ſpread it ſelfe in the life of man, who ſo blind

Is not this the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and common courſe, of moſt men, to reuile, to ſpeake euill, to iudge, at their pleaſure, whatſoeuer is not ſquared after their fancies, then which, there is not a greater, and more manifold miſchiefe in the life of man? This vice is ſo odious in the ſight of God, that the Spirit of God reckoneth back-biters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the curſed crue which God hath giuen ouer to a reprobate minde: <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Chryſ. ſup. Math.</note> A back-biter is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe image of the deuill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>fingendo,</hi> by forging againſt his neighbour things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is innocent.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by writing infamous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt any man, or inuectiues, <hi>Lenocinio verborum fucatas.</hi> The firſt of theſe is a great ſinne, for it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a breach of the Law of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correction: The ſecond grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it is ioyned with a lye
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18915:131"/>and ſlander: The third moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, becauſe a man is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally infamed by writing then by words onely.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of theſe ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and poyſoned, tongues, <note place="margin">The crafty Backbiter.</note> is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor aſtutus,</hi> the crafty, or ſubtile detractor: for there are of this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed kinde which with a ſubtile ſtile and pollitique carriage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues will tranſfufe and ſpread the venome and poyſon of their tongues like a ſerpent, to the hurt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their neighbour: And this is alſo three manner of waies, <hi>Tacendo, Negando, Venenando,</hi> by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by denying, by poyſoning their ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>By their ſilence: As when a man is asked of the vertues of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though he ſpeake no euill, yet hee concealeth the vertues and good gifts of his neighbour, which he knoweth and ought to haue ſpoken; and this he doth of hatred and enuy he beareth to his neighbour; as if he be asked of the chaſtity, ſobriety,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18915:132"/>learning, liberallity, or other gifts of God beſtowed vpon his neighbour; he either ſaies nothing, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, I know not, I will not meddle with other mens doings, &amp;c. This kind of Backbiter, though not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, yet indirectly, hurteth the good name of his neighbour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well ſaith <hi>Gilbertus: Grauis eſt rapacitas cum veram alterius gloriam etſimendacio non corrumpis, ſilentio ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men praeteris:</hi> It is a grieuous theft, though with a lie thou corrupteſt not the glory of another, yet with ſilence thou paſſeſt it ouer: And therforein this peſtilent kind, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imps of the deuill ſinneth againſt the goodneſſe and glory of God, and as much as in him lyeth (ô feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinne) ſeeketh to ouerthrow and obſcure it: againſt his goodneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all graces, vertues, and good things, which are in any man are Gods gifts, and ſparkles of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite treaſure of his bottomeleſſe bounty. Now to ſeeke by our ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to ſuppreſſe the ſame, what is
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18915:132"/>it elſe but to offer iniury vnto God, and to raſe out his goodneſſe, and ſo (as much as is poſſible) to obſcure his God-head, who is altogether and nothing but goodneſſe: he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt the glory of God; for the vertues that are in any man God would haue to be lights to ſhine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others vnto his glory; for our good deeds are a part of his glory as hee ſaith: <note place="margin">Mat. 5.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee your good workes and glorifie your Father which is in heauen:</hi> Therefore to ſeeke by our ſilence to obſcure the vertues of any, what is it elſe but to labour to put out the light which God would haue to ſhine vnto the world? and ſo to ſhew our ſelues enemies to Gods glory.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of theſe ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongues are ſuch, <note place="margin">Second kinde.</note> which though they ſay no euill of their neighbours, yet they deny the good properties which they heare others to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in them, and thinke the praiſes of others to bee an obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18915:133"/>of themſelues.</p>
               <p>The third ſort are ſuch which cunningly backbite their neighbour <hi>venenando,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The third ſort.</note> as when they are enforced to ſpeake much good of an other, whom they know to bee fauoured of him to whom they ſpeake, they will preſently poyſon the ſame againe with ſome exception: As, hee is a good man if hee had not this or that infirmity, &amp;c. or ſuch a man hath many good gifts if hee had not this or that defect; or ſuch a one is learned, but he wanteth humility; ſuch a man or woman is honeſt, &amp;c. but very proud: So theſe cunning backbiters, that they might not ſeeme to bee backbiters will praiſe, that they may with the greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty diſpraiſe againe, and ſo with hony they reach poyſon to drink, and as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith: <note place="margin">Hieron.</note> 
                  <hi>Venena non dant niſimelle circumlita: peſſimum genus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, qui cum maxime fallunt id agunt vt boni viri eſſe videntur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> they giue their poyſon coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with hony: They are the worſt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18915:133"/>kind of men of all, which when they meane moſt deceit, they ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, that they might ſeeme to bee good men. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Valer. Max.</note> that when it was related vnto <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> that many ſpake euill of him, hee anſwered: <hi>Oportet ſapientiam ab niſipientibus feriri:</hi> Fooles muſt needs ſtrike at wiſedome: <note place="margin">Valer.</note> And <hi>Valerius</hi> giueth the reaſon, <hi>Eſſe enim meliorem indicat quem carpit;</hi> he plainely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he whom he back-biteth is a better man then himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The third kind of theſe Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongues are the counterfeit and hipocriticall back-biters;
<note place="margin">The hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall backbiter.</note> and thoſe alſo caſt forth the poyſon of their tongues three manner of waies, <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendo, augendo, nominando:</hi> by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit ſorrow, faigning good will to their neighbour; by encreaſing and amplyfying their neighbours faults; by naming him with praiſe, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adding his vices.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they will faigne in words, geſture, and ſighes, that they ſpeake not for any ill will, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18915:134"/>their neighbour, and publiſh his infirmities, but that they ſpeake charitably, when yet they are full of impiety, enuy, and malice: As, I am ſorry for ſuch a man, or ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he would do ſuch a thing, otherwiſe he were a good man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the hipocrites will back-bite, <hi>augendo,</hi> as when they ſpeake of any ſmall infirmity of their neighbour, they will in words am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie the ſame, ſaying; There is like to grow a great inconuenience of ſuch a mans doing, of purpoſe that they might aggrauate a ſmall offence and ſo make the party odious vnto others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>nominando,</hi> as when they will name any man with praiſe, but will preſently adde the vices he is ſubiect vnto. This vice is directly contrary to the law of charity, the <hi>very band of perfectneſſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Coloſſ 3.</note> whereby we are (if wee bee in Chriſt) coupled together in one myſticall Body. This is a manifeſt breach of the ſecond Table of Gods Diuine Law, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18915:134"/>therefore God himſelfe in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Common-wealth of Iſrael, his people, commandeth, that none ſhould go about as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters and ſlanderers among his people. <note place="margin">Leuit. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to handle of this matter, <note place="margin">In three reſpects a grieuous ſinne.</note> was how grieuous a ſinne this is; which wee may gather three manner of waies, in regard of the generality, cruelty, and contrariety of this vice.</p>
               <p>In regard of the contrariety it is a great and dangerous ſinne, <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety.</note> for it is contrary to our good name, which of all worldly things is moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <note place="margin">Prou. 22.</note>

               <p>The fourth thing, which ſheweth the greatneſſe of this vice of the tongue is the ſeuerity of Gods iudgements denounced againſt the ſame, <note place="margin">Pſal. 52.2.</note> as; <hi>Thy tongue imagineth miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and with lies thou cutteſt like a ſharpe razor that cutteth deceitfully.</hi> And againe, <note place="margin">Hab. 2.11.22.</note>

               <p>The third tongue is, <hi>lingua men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dax,</hi> the lying tongue: A vice as common vnto many, as words are to their mouthes; in their vſuall talk, commerce, and communication, it is ſo ordinary and familiar with them, as if their whole life had ben a Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip to the father of lyes, to learne the faculty of lying, ſo prompt and ready are they therein, as if it were the miſtery of their ſtudy all their life long. There are many reaſons why this vice ſhould bee vtterly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from among men: becauſe we are members one of another, and members of the ſame body of Chriſt, which is the Church, and the Head of this Body is the Truth it ſelfe: <hi>I am the Truth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>And there was no deceit found in his mouth.</hi>

Firſt, to write or ſpeake that which is falſe, and that againſt the truth that is in the minde: For truth is an equality betweene the ſpeech and the minde,
<note place="margin">Truth what it is.</note> ſo far as the ſpeech agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the minde: Therefore lying is an inequality betweene the ſpeech and the minde: for <hi>mentiri,</hi> is <hi>quaſi contra mentem ire.</hi> Secondly, that this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18915:149"/>is done by the rule and commanding of the will, repugning to the mind. Thirdly, that this is done of purpoſe to deceiue. From this triple end of lying came this common diuiſion of a lye, into <hi>Officioſum,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Three kinds of lies.</note> 
                  <hi>Iocoſum</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitioſum:</hi> the officious lye, the ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lie, and the pernicious lie.</p>
               <p>The ieſting, or ſporting, lie, they ſay, is that which is framed to feede and pleaſe the mindes of the hearers with a certaine delectation: This if it bee vſed to delight and profite any man, by ſome neceſſary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> excepteth it from lies: Such are Apologues, Fables, Parables, <hi>Tropicall Locutions,</hi> hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles, &amp;c. which no wiſe man euer reckoned among lies, if there be in them no habite of lying and vanity in ſpeaking: Therefore againſt the ſporting lie I thus conclude; either there is in our ieſts ſome profitable doctrine, and then they are not lies, and therefore my purpoſe is not to reproue theſe: or elſe there is in them a vaine intent and purpoſe, and then
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18915:150"/>they are lies, and to bee reiected of all good men, and left to ſcoffers and vaine perſons.</p>
               <p>Now for the officious lie, ſome commend vnto vs a <hi>fine,</hi> from the end or intent thereof: Firſt, becauſe it profiteth in the externall goods of fortune, and is againſt no man: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it profiteth alſo to the conſeruation of life oftentimes, and hurteth no man: Thirdly, that it hath place alſo in ſpirituall things, and defendeth ſometimes from much vncleanneſſe, which otherwiſe men might fall into. But againſt all this I oppoſe, that wee may not do euill that good may come of it: if lying be an euill, as indeed it is, it ought not to bee practiſed for any hope of good to enſue whatſoeuer; neither doe this proue that lying is in any wiſe lawfull. <note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> The arguments they obiect againſt this are indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as the examples of godly men in the old Teſtament, to which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth. Firſt, that many things, do there ſeeme to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18915:150"/>bee lies, which indeed are not, as that of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaying of his wife ſhee is my ſiſter, <note place="margin">Gen. 12.</note> hee ſaid the truth according to the manner of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, becauſe ſhe was <hi>filia patrum ſui,</hi> which had among them the name of parents: and that of <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſaying to his father <hi>Iſaac,</hi>

               <p>Now it remaineth that I pray and beſeech (you brethren) to whom your life and ſaluation is deere, that yee carefully, conſidering the heape of euils that the wicked tongue bringeth with it, you would call daily vpon him in whom it onely

For the beter gouernment then of this little member it would greatly profite to obſerue theſe foure things: <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, what wee ſhould ſpeake: Secondly, the manner of our ſpeech: Thirdly, the time when wee ſhould ſpeake: Fourthly, and the cauſe why we ſhould ſpeak.</p>

               <p>For the firſt wee are to obſerue this of the Apoſtle: <note place="margin">Ephe. 4.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouthes, but that which is good to the vſe of edifying, that it may miniſter grace to the hearers:</hi> And this in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he expreſſeth more plaine: <hi>But fornication,</hi>

               <p n="2">2 In the manner of our ſpeech wee ſhould bee circumſpect, that we ſpeake conſiderately, aduiſedly, without too much affectation of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, delicate, or exquiſite words; but with grauity, mildneſſe, ſobriety,

               <p n="4">4 The laſt thing in ſpeech to bee conſidered is the cauſe; for ſome will vtter wiſe ſentences that they may be thought to bee wiſe, and others becauſe they would ſhew the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their wit and eloquence: the firſt is an note of an hypocrite, the other the marke of a foole deſirous of vaine-glory.

               <p>If any thinke it hard to obſerue theſe rules, I counſell him to make his refuge the ſafe port of filence,
